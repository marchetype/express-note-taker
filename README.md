  ## Description
  - This application uses back-end technology in tandem with a front end that was cloned from starter code. The back-end uses express.js to send GET and POST requests to api links as well as links for different HTML files of the page. The functionality of the app, from a practical standpoint, is to provide the user with the ability to save their notes on the site and access the ones that they have saved when they return to the page. Eventually, the project will include the ability to delete notes that have been saved on the left side of the screen.
  ## Installation
  - In order to run the application, the user does not need to install anything since it is deployed on Heroku. If the user would like, however, they may clone the repository, initialize npm, and install express using npm in order to run locally.
  ## Usage
  - In order to take a note down, simply enter the title in the upper text area, and the content of the note within the lower area. Once you have entered text into both sections, you will be able to select a save icon on the top right of the screen. Upon clicking this, the note will be saved within the database (due to a bug, the data does not render to the page at the moment, but this will be fixed hopefully soon).
